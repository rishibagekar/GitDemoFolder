When nature meets adventure!

 

The life of most kids today has become very sedentary and much time is spent online using gadgets. Would it not be nice for our kids to connect back with nature? Would it not be nice for our kids to interact with others which provides them with experiences that challenges and encourages them to think, grow, and ask questions?

Adventurous play helps one to deal with stressful and challenging situations later in life.
